# 12. Cross Region Replication

- Must enable versioning (source and destination)
- Buckets can be in different AWS regions / same AWS region
- Can be in different accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
