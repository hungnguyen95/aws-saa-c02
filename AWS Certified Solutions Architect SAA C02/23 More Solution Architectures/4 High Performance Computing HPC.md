# 4. High Performance Computing (HPC)

- The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC
- You can create a very high number of resources in no time
- You can speed up time to results by adding more resources
- You can pay only for the systems you have used
- Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving

# Data Management & Transfer

- **AWS Direct Connect:**
    - Move GB/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network
- **Snowball & Snowmobile**
    - Move PB of data to the cloud
- **AWS DataSync**
    - Move large amount of data between on-premise and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows

# Compute and Networking

- EC2 Instances:
    - CPU optimized, GPU optimized
    - Spot Instances / Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling
- EC2 Placement Groups: **Cluster** for good network performance

![4%20High%20Performance%20Computing%20HPC/Untitled.png](4%20High%20Performance%20Computing%20HPC/Untitled.png)

- EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
    - Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency
    - Option 1: **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)** up to 100 Gbps
    - Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps â€“ LEGACY
- **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)**
    - Improved **ENA** for HPC, only works for **Linux**
    - Great for inter-node communications, **tightly coupled workloads**
    - Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
    - Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

# Storage

- Instance-attached storage:
    - **EBS**: scale up to 64000 IOPS with io1 Provisioned IOPS
    - **Instance Store**: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
- Network storage:
    - **Amazon S3**: large blob, not a file system
    - **Amazon EFS**: scale IOPS based on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
    - **Amazon FSx for Lustre:**
        - HPC optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS
        - Backed by S3

# Automation and Orchestration

- AWS Batch
    - **AWS Batch** supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enables you to run single jobs that span multiple **EC2** instances
    - Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly

- AWS ParallelCluster
    - Open source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
    - Configure with text files
    - Automate creation of VPC, Subnet, cluster type and instance types
