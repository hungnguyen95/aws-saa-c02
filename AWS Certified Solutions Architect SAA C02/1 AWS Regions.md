# 1. AWS Regions

- AWS has regions all around the world(us-east-1)
- Each region has availability zones (useast-1a, us-east-1b…)
- Each availability zone is a physical datacenter in the region, but separate from the other ones (so that they’re isolated from disasters)
- AWS Consoles are region scoped(except IAM, S3 & Route53)
- Each AWS region is basiclly built around a minimum of 3 data centers (Availability Zones)

→ Anything that ends with a letter is an AZ
