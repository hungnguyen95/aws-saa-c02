Let's take a hotel as an example to compare.

- **On demand:** coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price

    → You arrive and you say: "I want a room" - "Yes, we have a room sir" and boom, here we go.

- **Reserved**: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.

    → Because you know in advance that you're going to stay and they know the room is going to be booked.

- **Spot instances:**  the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at anytime
- **Dedicated Hosts**: We book an entire building of the resort
