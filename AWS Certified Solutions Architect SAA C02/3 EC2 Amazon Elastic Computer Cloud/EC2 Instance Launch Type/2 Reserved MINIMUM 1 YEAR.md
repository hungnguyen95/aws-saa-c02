### Reserved have **3 Types:**

    Instead of saying you want an m4.xlarge for 1 year, you're saying I want something for one year and you can convert what that something is. So maybe it's an m4.xlarge today, but maybe it's gonna be a c5.large tomorrow.

- **Scheduled Reserved Instances:**

    You wanna have instance every Thursday between 3p.m and 6p.m. Other than that you don't need it, but I know I will need this for at least a year.
