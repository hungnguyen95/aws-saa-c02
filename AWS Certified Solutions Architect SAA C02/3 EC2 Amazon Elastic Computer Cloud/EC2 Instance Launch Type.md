### *Workload Concept*

A workload is a collection of resources and code that delivers business value, such as a customer-facing application or a backend process.

A workload might consist of a subset of resources in a single AWS account or be a collection of multiple resources spanning multiple AWS accounts. A small business might have only a few workloads while a large enterprise might have thousands.
