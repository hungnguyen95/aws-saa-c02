- When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role
- When using a resource based policy, the principal doesnâ€™t have to give up his permissions
- Example: User in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in Account B.
- Supported by: Amazon S3 buckets, SNS topics, SQS queues
