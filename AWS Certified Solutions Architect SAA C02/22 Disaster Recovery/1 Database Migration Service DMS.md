# 1. Database Migration Service (DMS)

- Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self healing
- The source database remains available during the migration
- Supports:
    - Homogeneous migrations: ex Oracle to Oracle
    - Heterogeneous migrations: ex Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora
- Continuous Data Replication using CDC (Change Data Capture)
- You must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks

- **You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine**
    - Ex: On-Premise PostgreSQL => RDS PostgreSQL
    - The DB engine is still PostgreSQL (RDS is the platform)
