# 5. Scaling Policies

- **Target Tracking Scaling**
    - Most simple and easy to set-up
    - Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%

        That means if you're over that CPU, you will provision more instances to serve your ASG, and if you're under that CPU, it will start doing scaling in â†’ stay around average 40% CPU

- **Simple / Step Scaling**

    You would set up something called a CloudWatch alarm

    - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
    - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
- **Scheduled Actions**
    - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
    - For e.g: you know that at 5p.m on Fridays, you need to increase the min capacity to 10 instances because you know that you will need
